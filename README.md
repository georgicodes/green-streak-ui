green-streak-ui
==========================

## Purpose
The project has been forked from ionic-angular-cordova-seed. It contains a fully functional app that has a Side Menu
with navigation.

The aim of this project was to extend the functionality demonstrated [here](http://ionicframework
.com/examples/side-menu/) by allowing navigation by clicking on the items within the side menu.

The project is well structured and contains app.js, controllers.js and services.js files.

Changes have only been made to /templates, index.html and app.js, controllers.js and services.js. Everything else
remains the same as the ionic-angular-cordova-seed project.

## Running the app
For development purposes it's easiest to run with: 
```bash
$ cd www
$ pythom -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Alternatively, run it with phonegap:
```bash
$ phonegap run ios
```
